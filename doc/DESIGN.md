# Lists - UX design notes

## Motivation

Most people use to-do lists - it's a ubiquitous concept. They take various forms, like shopping lists, post-it notes or unread emails. Ensuring that you have easy access to any number of lists, anywhere you are, can be a great productivity boost, or even just help with daily life. 

## Market research

The majority of people settle on the note-taking apps in their phones, but some dedicated apps exist that have extra functionality. Here are a few examples:

   - [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app), the note-taking app from Microsoft's Office suite,
   - [Listonic](https://listonic.com), a shopping list app for mobile,
   - [Google Tasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks), an Android to-do list app by Google,
   - [ColorNote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialnmobile.dictapps.notepad.color.note), an Android app for taking colorful notes on the go.

Many of these allow taking notes of any kind, not just lists of tasks. They commonly save the lists to online storage, allowing multiple people to access the lists, or to access them from multiple devices. Aside from that, they are often intentionally low on bells and whistles - the developers realize that with note-taking, ease and speed of use are king.
